**AI shotlive Director** is an **AI-powered, one-stop platform** for **short dramas** and **motion comics**, built for creators who want to go from idea to final video fast.

Moving away from the traditional "slot machine" style of random generation, AiShotlive adopts an industrial **"Script-to-Asset-to-Keyframe"** workflow. With deep integration of AntSK API’s advanced AI models, it enables **one-sentence to complete drama** — fully automated from **script** to **final video**, while maintaining precise control over character consistency, scene continuity, and camera movement.

## Core Philosophy: Keyframe-Driven

Traditional Text-to-Video models often struggle with specific camera movements and precise start/end states. AiShotlive introduces the animation concept of **Keyframes**:

1.  **Draw First, Move Later**: First, generate precise Start and End frames.
2.  **Interpolation**: Use the Veo model to generate smooth video transitions between these two frames.
3.  **Asset Constraint**: All visual generation is strictly constrained by "Character Sheets" and "Scene Concepts" to prevent hallucinations or inconsistencies.

## Key Features

### Phase 01: Novel & Script
*   **Project Settings Integrated**: Project title, genre, visual style, language and other settings are managed directly in the Novel Management page — no page switching needed.
*   **Novel → Script**: Upload `.txt` novel files, auto-parse chapters with pagination support, select chapters to create episodes, and AI adapts them into full scripts.
*   **Episode Isolation**: Each episode maintains independent data for characters, storyboards, and assets.
*   **Intelligent Breakdown**: Input a novel or story outline, and the AI automatically breaks it down into a standard script structure (Scenes, Time, Atmosphere).
*   **Visual Translation**: Automatically converts text descriptions into professional visual prompts.
*   **Pacing Control**: Set target durations (e.g., 30s Teaser, 3min Short), and the AI plans shot density accordingly.
*   **Manual Editing**: Edit character visual descriptions, shot prompts, character lists, action descriptions and dialogues for each shot.

### Phase 02: Assets & Casting
*   **Character Consistency**:
    *   Generate standard Reference Images for every character.
    *   **Wardrobe System**: Support for multiple looks (e.g., Casual, Combat, Injured) while maintaining facial identity based on a Base Look.
*   **Set Design**: Generate environmental reference images to ensure lighting consistency across different shots in the same location.

### Phase 03: Director Workbench
*   **Grid Storyboard**: Manage all shots in a panoramic view.
*   **Precise Control**:
    *   **Start Frame**: The strictly consistent starting image of the shot.
    *   **End Frame**: (Optional) Define the state at the end of the shot (e.g., character turns head, lighting shifts).
*   **Nine-Grid Storyboard Preview (NEW)**:
    *   Split one shot into 9 viewpoints, review/edit panel descriptions, then generate the 3x3 storyboard image.
    *   Use the whole grid as the start frame, or crop a selected panel as the start frame.
*   **Context Awareness**: When generating shots, the AI automatically reads the Context (Current Scene Image + Character's Specific Outfit Image) to solve continuity issues.
*   **Dual Video Modes**: Supports single-image Image-to-Video and Start/End keyframe interpolation.

### Phase 04: Export
*   **Timeline Preview**: Preview generated motion comic segments in a timeline format.
*   **Render Tracking**: Monitor API render progress in real-time.
*   **Asset Export**: Export all high-def keyframes and MP4 clips for post-production in Premiere/After Effects.

### Account Management
*   Click your username in the sidebar or project list to open Account Settings.
*   Change username and password after verifying your current password.

### Data Export & Import
*   **Export**: From System Settings, export the current user's entire database (projects, assets, visual styles, model config, preferences) plus all media files from the `data/` folder as a single ZIP archive.
*   **Import**: Upload a ZIP backup file, and the system automatically creates a new user account and imports all data under it. The new username and default password are displayed upon completion.
*   Ideal for cross-server migration, periodic backups, and disaster recovery.

## ⚠️ Open-Source & “Free” Clarification (Please Read)

* **Model usage note**: This open-source project’s default workflow requires a capability-matched model stack, for example an LLM (such as **GPT-5.2**), an image model (such as **Nano Banana Pro**), and a video model (such as **Sora-2** / **Veo-3.1**). If you want to connect other providers or models, you can modify and adapt it yourself.
* **Why we open-sourced this**: Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry and make creation more accessible. The project code is open-source, and model configuration is replaceable.
* **About our API service**: The API we provide is mainly for quick experience and integration, not as a core profit source.
* **Freedom of choice**: If our API does not meet your expectations, you can absolutely use official OpenAI or Google services directly (even at a higher price). That is a normal and respected choice.
* **About “always free” expectations**: If your primary criterion is long-term “must be free,” this project may not be the best fit for you.

## Desktop Client Packaging (Electron)

The desktop client is packaged with Electron and includes an embedded SQLite database. It works out of the box — no MySQL or server setup required.

### Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS, for native module compilation): `xcode-select --install`
- **Visual Studio Build Tools** (Windows, for native module compilation)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time or after changes)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Build + package for current platform
npm run build:electron

# Package for macOS only (.dmg)
npm run build:electron:mac

# Package for Windows only (.exe)
npm run build:electron:win
```

### Build Pipeline

```
npm run build:client          # Vite compiles frontend → dist/
npm run build:server          # tsc compiles server → server/dist/
npm run build:electron-main   # tsc compiles Electron entry → electron/dist/
npx electron-builder          # Package into installer → release/
```

### Output Artifacts

| Platform | Artifact | Architecture |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| macOS | `release/AI-ShotLive-{version}-mac-arm64.dmg` | Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) |
| macOS | `release/AI-ShotLive-{version}-mac-x64.dmg` | Intel |
| Windows | `release/AI-ShotLive-Setup-{version}-win.exe` | x64 |

### Data Storage Location

Desktop client data is stored separately from the application:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/ai-shotlive-director/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/ai-shotlive-director/` |

Contains: `local.db` (SQLite database), `data/` (media files), `uploads/` (uploaded files)

### Customization

Place a `.env` file in the data directory to override default settings (e.g., API Keys, JWT secret).

### Notes

- `better-sqlite3` is a native C++ module; electron-builder automatically recompiles it for the target Electron version
- Cross-platform Windows packaging requires a Windows environment (or CI)
- App icons are in `electron/icons/`; replace `icon.png` and follow `electron/icons/README.md` to generate `.icns` / `.ico`

---

## Quick Start

1.  **Login**: Use the default account (admin / admin123) or register a new user. Click your username to update account info.
2.  **Configure Models**: In Model Config, enter API Keys for your preferred providers and select active text/image/video models.
3.  **Project & Script**: In Phase 01, project settings (title, genre, style) are managed alongside the novel. Upload a `.txt` novel → parse chapters → create episodes → generate scripts; or paste a story directly.
4.  **Assets**: Go to Phase 02, generate character sheets and scene concepts.
5.  **Shots & Export**: In Phase 03, generate the Start Frame first; for tighter control, add an End Frame or use the Nine-Grid preview. Phase 04 for preview and export.
